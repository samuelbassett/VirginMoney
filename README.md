# VirginMoney
  App designed for all employees at Virgin Money to quickly pull up and use to gather the contact details of any of their colleagues.
  Those details include:
  - Employee first and last name
  - Employee job title
  - Employee email
  - Date joined
  - Employee Avatar
  - Employee favorite color displayed in the background of their card and profile

  Another feature is for employees to check for available rooms in the office. If the room is available then it will read 'OPEN' and if not 'OCCUPIED.' There is also a max occupancy attached for each room.
